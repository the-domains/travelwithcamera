  You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You must develop a complete
  disregard for where your abilities end. Try to do things that you're incapable
  of... If you think you're incapable of running a company, make that your
  aim... Make your vision of where you want to be a reality. Nothing is
  impossible. Paul Arden
